## Hi there 👋

I am an enthusiastic Frontend Developer with a solid foundation in web development, currently specializing in React. I began my coding journey by completing a year-long bootcamp where I learned C# and .NET. Technologies I used were Winforms, ASP.NET, .NET Core (Blazor, Maui). Recently, I transitioned to frontend development, enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through books and platforms like Scrimba.

As I dive deeper into React, I am actively building and uploading projects to showcase my growing expertise. My background in programming, combined with my commitment to continuous learning, positions me well for a role in a dynamic development environment.

With seven years of experience working at the local post office, I bring strong communication skills and a proven ability to work well under pressure. I am eager to contribute my knowledge and passion for frontend development to a collaborative team and create engaging user experiences.
